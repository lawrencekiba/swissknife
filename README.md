# swissknife
A go-to repo of my tools and code for pretty much anything.

Just like Swiss Army knife being known for their versatility, I aim to create this repo to have a high versatility to cater to any projects I am working on. This might actually be bigger than any other projects I am working on now or in future, as this is going to be an ongoing work as I gain more knowledge and learn more useful tools to use along the way. 

As for now, this would be the components of my so-called software Swiss Knife

1. Large blade
A collection of machine learning code & tools I intend to use to make it easier to kickstart my machine learning projects.

2. Small blade
A collection of classical computer science algorithms I intend to understand and hope to be useful in the upcoming projects.

3. Can opener
The heavy maths behind things, especially behind large blade.

4. Screwdriver
5. Key ring
6. Tweezers

I will add more as it goes.
